# Loan-approval-prediction
Problem Statement: Loan approval is a critical decision for financial institutions. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict loan applications that are likely to be approved or denied.
Approach:Logistic Regression is employed as the machine learning model. This model is suitable for binary classification problems, where the output is a binary variable (in this case, "Approved" or "Denied").
